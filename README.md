# First Semester - Basics of programming

Tasks from the laboratory: basics of programming.
Tasks come from https://www.mat.umk.pl:8070/ZawodyWeb or they are additionally asked by the lecturer.
I used the functional programing paradigm and the c++ 14 standard.

Learning the basics program in C ++: 
- conditional statement
- loops
- functions
- arrays
- operations on strings
- basic data structures - stack, queue, priority queue
- input/output from file
- sorting algorithms:
    > bubblesort, 
    > insertion sort, 
    > merge sort, 
    > selection sort, 
    > quicksort, 
    > heapsort, 
    > as a semester project: introsort
