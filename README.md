# First Semester - Basics of programming

Tasks from the laboratory: [__Basics of programming__](https://usosweb.umk.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=1000-I1PPR).

Tasks come from [ZawodyWeb](https://www.mat.umk.pl:8070/ZawodyWeb) or they are additionally asked by the lecturer.

I used the __functional programming__ paradigm and the __C++14__. standard.

Learning the basics program in C ++:
- variables
- conditional statements
- loops
- functions
- arrays
- operations on strings
- basic data structures
    - stack
    - queue 
    - priority queue
- input/output from file
- sorting algorithms:
    - bubblesort
    - insertion sort 
    - merge sort
    - selection sort 
    - quicksort
    - heapsort
    - as a semester project: [introsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort)

### Introsort

This is a hybrid sorting alghorithm, which eliminated problem with worst-case performance _O(n^2)_ in quicksort algorithm. My implementation uses three other sorting algorithms: heapsort, quicksort (with med3) and selectionsort for small sets of numbers.

Complexity of this alghorithm in all cases: _O(n*log(n))_
